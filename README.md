# Smart-Traffic-Light-System

My Python Program is to develop a new Traffic Light System for a four-way intersection as I am a part of a team developing smart infrastructure for a growing city. I have been tasked by the city council with creating a prototype for a smart traffic light system which can efficiently manage and regulate traffic flow during a busy intersection. My traffic system manages the traffic flow for all four directions which are - North, East, South and West. In addition to this, I had to implement the standard traffic light states which include the colours - Red, Yellow and Green. To ensure protected traffic flow, I also included considerations for pedestrian crossing as well as implementing a priority system for emergency vehicles. 

My algorithm outlining the logic of my traffic light system is that it manages traffic at a four-way intersection, it contains key components such as light states, timing and directions, as well as constants whereby the timing state of green, yellow, red and pedestrian crossings are 25 seconds, 5 seconds, 25 seconds and 10 seconds, respectively. Along with this, my algorithm also contains a factor of which there is a prime concern for emergency vehicles and how this may change the overall impact of ongoing traffic flow. In addition to this, my algorithm also accommodates pedestrian crossing and how ongoing traffic may affect pedestrians as well as pedestrians affecting ongoing traffic.
